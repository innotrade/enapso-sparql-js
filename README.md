# enapso-sparql-js
Enapso SPARQL Abstraction for Node.js

**The following demos require a running GraphDB 8.x instance on localhost at port 7200. The demos as well as the automated tests require a fully working Ontotext GraphDB repository "Test" and a user "Test" with the password "Test" being set up, which has read/write access to the "Test" Repository.**
